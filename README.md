# Student-Placement-Data-Mining-Predictive-Modelling

The aim of this research is to build and compare multiple prediction models for forecasting student placement outcomes based on studentâ€™s performance in school by exploring and pre-processing a student placement dataset to identify the best and most accurate model for prediction. Clustering is also used to identify underlying patterns and structures within the dataset.

This is a group project, but I have only included my individual contributions in this repository.

The XML files are supposed to be imported into SAS Enterprise Miner to be viewed
- Regression1 contains regression models without variable selection
- Regression2 contains regression models with variable selection
- Regression3 contains high-performance regression models

Please view the documentation if it is not possible to load the XML files. All diagrams, processes, analysis, and results are included in the document.

Tools Used:
- SAS Enterprise Miner
- Regression Models (Forward, Backward, Stepwise Regression & varying polynomial degrees)
